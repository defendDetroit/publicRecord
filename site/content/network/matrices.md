This page is the **machine-readable layer** of the network map. The [Mermaid diagrams](/network/) show the network visually. These matrices show it **computationally** — every relationship as a cell in a table, every money flow as a row in a ledger.

## Board Membership Matrix {{ confidence(level="verified") }}

**Who governs what.** Every cell is a public record. Blank = no documented role.

| Person | PCA | MacDowell | Purpose Foundation | Anchor Rock | Bank on Banks PAC | OFA Michigan |
|--------|:---:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:------------:|
| **{{ actor(key="banks") }}** | Superintendent | Superintendent | President + Agent | — | — | — |
| **{{ actor(key="holland") }}** | — | — | Secretary + Treasurer | — | Treasurer | Officer |
| **{{ actor(key="miller") }}** | **Board Chair** | — | — | Board Chair (dissolved) | — | — |
| **{{ actor(key="yancey") }}** | — | **Board Chair** | — | — | — | — |
| **Lamar Moreland** (Asst. AG) | Board Vice Chair | — | — | — | — | — |
| **Latisha Johnson** (City Council) | Board Secretary | — | — | — | — | — |

**Pattern**: Two convicted felons control the revenue entities (schools + CMO + foundation). Three judges + two government officials govern the boards. The felon and the judge sit on the same org chart.

## Court Assignment Matrix {{ confidence(level="verified") }}

**Which judges sit where.** The enterprise generates cases in Wayne County courts. These judges have documented connections to the enterprise.

| Judge | Court | Connection to Enterprise | Status |
|-------|-------|------------------------|--------|
| {{ actor(key="miller") }} | **Wayne 3rd Circuit** | PCA Board Chair | Active — ballot Nov 2026 |
| {{ actor(key="sabree") }} | **Wayne 3rd Circuit** (Family) | MSU Law classmate · father = Treasurer | Active — appointed May 2025 |
| {{ actor(key="ramsey") }} | **Wayne 3rd Circuit** (Criminal) | 2 family on MacDowell payroll | Active |
| {{ actor(key="evans") }} | Wayne 3rd Circuit | 21-year mentor | Retired (JTC) |
| {{ actor(key="yancey") }} | **36th District** | MacDowell Board Chair · paid $383.82 | Active |
| {{ actor(key="adam_sabree") }} | **36th District** | Eric Sabree's son · Metro Property RICO | Active |
| {{ actor(key="sean_perkins") }} | **36th District** | Brother = Banks' attorney | Active |
| {{ actor(key="perkins_david") }} | **Probate Court** | Family donations · guardianship jurisdiction | Active |
| {{ actor(key="langford_morris") }} | Oakland County | Wrote book foreword with fake J.D. | Retired (JAMS) |

**Coverage**: 4 judges in 3rd Circuit, 3 judges in 36th District, 1 in Probate, 1 in Oakland. Any case involving Banks' network in Wayne County risks landing before a connected judge.

## For Analysts and AI Agents

### Python (NetworkX)
```python
import json, networkx as nx

with open('graph.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

G = nx.DiGraph()
for n in data['nodes']:
    G.add_node(n['id'], **n)
for e in data['edges']:
    G.add_edge(e['source'], e['target'], **e)

# Find all paths from state funding to Banks
for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, 'macdowell', 'banks'):
    print(' → '.join(path))

# Centrality — who is the most connected?
cent = nx.degree_centrality(G)
for node, score in sorted(cent.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])[:5]:
    print(f"{G.nodes[node].get('label', node)}: {score:.3f}")
```

### R (igraph)
```r
library(igraph)
edges <- read.csv("https://detroit.primals.eco/graph.csv")
g <- graph_from_data_frame(edges[, c("source_id", "target_id")], directed = TRUE)
plot(g, vertex.label = V(g)$name, vertex.size = degree(g) * 3)
```

### Gephi
1. Download [graph.csv](/graph.csv)
2. Import as Edge Table (source_id → target_id)
3. Use `edge_type` for edge coloring, `weight` for thickness
