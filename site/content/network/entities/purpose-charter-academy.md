## School Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | K-8 charter school |
| Location | Detroit, Michigan |
| Authorizer | Detroit Public Schools Community District (DPSCD) |
| Management | The Purpose Group, LLC |
| Superintendent | Brian Roderick Banks |

Purpose Charter Academy (PCA) is a K-8 charter school serving Detroit students. DPSCD authorized the school. The Purpose Group, LLC — a management company controlled by Banks — handles day-to-day operations.

## DOE Certificate Timing

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Certificate | AD0000048782 |
| Issued | September 2, 2022 |
| Context | **3 days after the school year started** |

The Michigan Department of Education issued PCA's operating certificate on September 2, 2022 — three days after the school year had already begun.

## Credential Fraud {{ confidence(level="verified") }}

Banks serves as superintendent while claiming credentials he cannot verify.

| Claim | Location |
|-------|----------|
| "Juris Doctor from Michigan State University College of Law" | purposecharteracademy.com |

State Bar of Michigan search for "Brian Banks": **zero results**. Banks has never been admitted to any bar.

## Board of Directors {{ confidence(level="verified") }}

Per [purposecharteracademy.com/boardofdirectors](https://www.purposecharteracademy.com/boardofdirectors) (retrieved Sep 2026):

| Position | Name | Title / Affiliation |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| **Board Chair** | **Hon. Cylenthia LaToye Miller** | **Judge, Wayne County 3rd Circuit Court** |
| Board Vice Chair | **Mr. Lamar Moreland** | **Assistant Attorney General, State of Michigan** |
| Board Secretary | **Hon. Latisha Johnson** | **Detroit City Council Member** |
| Board Treasurer | Mr. Devin Hutchings | Founder, DH Strategies |
| Board Asst. Treasurer | Mr. Major Clora | President/CEO, Clora Funeral Home |

### Institutional Capture Through the Board

A **sitting judge**, an **Assistant Attorney General**, and a **City Council member** serve on the board of a school run by a man with 9 criminal convictions and a fake J.D. This is not informal support — these are **governance positions** at a publicly funded entity.

| Board Member | Institution Captured | Conflict |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| {{ actor(key="miller") }} | **Wayne County 3rd Circuit** | Judge chairs board of felon's school; school generates cases in her court |
| Lamar Moreland | **Michigan Attorney General's Office** | The AG's office could investigate Banks; its own employee governs Banks' school |
| Latisha Johnson | **Detroit City Council** | Council oversees DPSCD, which authorized Banks' charter |

The AG connection is particularly significant: the Michigan Attorney General has jurisdiction over nonprofit fraud (Purpose Foundation), consumer protection (credential fraud), and RICO (the enterprise pattern). An AG employee serving on Banks' board creates a structural conflict with any potential investigation.

## Financial Structure

Public education dollars flow through a layered structure:

```
STATE OF MICHIGAN (per-pupil funding)
        │
        ▼
Purpose Charter Academy
        │
        ▼
The Purpose Group, LLC (management company)
        │
        ▼
Brian Roderick Banks (sole member)
```

Revenue passes through Purpose Group LLC rather than remaining under direct school control. The same management company structure appears at {{ entity(key="macdowell") }}, where {{ entity(key="macdowell", field="extraction_pct") }} of spending flows to Purpose Group.
