## Private Foundation Restrictions {{ confidence(level="documented") }}

Private foundation status triggers IRC §4940–4948 self-dealing prohibitions:

- **§4941** — Self-dealing between foundation and disqualified persons
- **§4942** — Minimum distribution requirements
- **§4943** — Excess business holdings
- **§4944** — Jeopardizing investments
- **§4945** — Taxable expenditures
- **§4946** — Definition of disqualified persons (includes substantial contributors, managers, and family members)
- **§4948** — Notice requirements for disqualified persons

Banks and Holland, as officers and disqualified persons, face strict limits on transactions between themselves and the foundation.
