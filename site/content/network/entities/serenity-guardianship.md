## Entity Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | Serenity Guardianship Services, Inc. |
| LARA ID | 802290962 |
| Type | Guardianship services |
| Status | **DISSOLVED** |
| Banks' Role | Agent |

Serenity Guardianship Services was a guardianship company operated by {{ actor(key="banks") }} — a **non-attorney** with **9 felony convictions** and no bar admission.

## Unauthorized Practice of Law {{ confidence(level="documented") }} (UPL)

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Operator | Brian Banks — never admitted to any bar ([State Bar verification](/validate/)) |
| Service type | Guardianship services — legal proceedings requiring court representation |
| Classification | Textbook **Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)** |
| Credential fraud | Banks claims "J.D." on school materials; no bar admission confirmed |

Guardianship involves court-supervised management of incapacitated persons' affairs. Operating a guardianship services company without legal licensure violates Michigan's UPL statutes and professional conduct rules.

## Significance

A convicted felon running guardianship services without legal credentials demonstrates the enterprise's pattern: operate in legally regulated spaces without qualification, extract value, and rely on [captured courts](/analysis/institutional-capture/) for protection when challenged.
