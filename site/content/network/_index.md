This is not one bad actor. It is a **network** — convicted felons, judges, attorneys, and institutions connected through boards, campaigns, property, and family ties.

The loop closes: public dollars → school → LLC → Banks → campaign payments → judges + politicians → charter authorization → more public dollars. No external oversight breaks the circle because each regulator sees only one segment.

## Four Dynasties — One Machine

This is not one corrupt individual. It is **four interlocking political dynasties** that converge on one charter school enterprise:

| Dynasty | Federal Record | Role in Machine |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **[Banks/Flenory (BMF)](/books/black-mafia-family/)** | OD Banks: BMF Defendant #22 | Blood lineage. Extraction playbook. |
| **[Stallworth](/network/political/stallworth-keith/)** | Keith: $20K gang money laundering | BCF incubation → MacDowell board → DPSCD authorization |
| **[Sabree](/network/political/eric-sabree/)** | FBI-probed, Bowles class action | Judicial capture — 2 children on the bench |
| **[Kilpatrick](/network/political/kilpatrick-dynasty/)** | Kwame: 24 RICO felonies, pardoned | PR (Dumas), dark money (Daniels), charter auth (Gay-Dagnogo) |

## Hiding Behind Racial Solidarity

The BCF's institutional armor was racial solidarity. The Black Caucus brand carried the weight of decades of legitimate civil rights work — work Alma Stallworth contributed to over 21 years.

But when the foundation board becomes a **reunion of felons** — Brian Banks (9 convictions), Keith Stallworth (federal money laundering), Virgil Smith (felony assault), Bert Johnson (federal bribery) — the armor becomes a weapon against the very community it claims to serve.

This is the same pattern at every tier: Judge [Miller](/network/judges/cylenthia-miller/) and [Aliyah Sabree](/network/judges/aliyah-sabree/) at MSU Law — real solidarity weaponized to shield a convicted felon running schools at 3% math proficiency. The children in those classrooms are overwhelmingly Black. 97% of them cannot do grade-level math. The solidarity that protects this outcome is not solidarity with them. It is solidarity among the adults who benefit from their silence.

Keith Stallworth's $20,000 was not an abstraction. The DOJ confirmed it came from "illegal activities" — laundered through a strip club that exploited women in the same community MacDowell now pretends to serve. The exploitation didn't end. It professionalized.

The son is not responsible for the sins of the father. But when the son inherits the trade — when the family infrastructure built on drug money becomes the pipeline that installs convicted felons in charge of children — the inheritance is the indictment.
