This page presents the complainant's analysis of documented relationships and financial flows, organized under the framework of 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (RICO). **The records are public. The relationships are documented. The pattern analysis is the complainant's inference, submitted to federal agencies for determination.** Whether these facts constitute racketeering is a legal conclusion that only a court or prosecutorial authority can make.

Each predicate act reinforces the others. Credential fraud enables school authorization → authorization enables revenue → revenue enables campaign payments → payments enable judicial protection → judicial protection prevents accountability → the cycle continues.
