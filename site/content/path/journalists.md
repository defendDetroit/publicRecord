## How to Use This

This is a **public evidence library**, not a news article. Every claim is cited to verifiable public records. The entire site is version-controlled in a [git repository]({{ config.extra.repo_url }}) that anyone can clone. Nothing is anonymous. Nothing is behind a paywall.

**You do not need a FOIA request.** Everything here comes from publicly accessible databases.
